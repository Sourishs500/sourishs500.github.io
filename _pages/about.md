Hi, my name is Sourish! I'm a senior undergrad at UCLA studying Computer Engineering. My technical interests include OS, distributed systems, and parallel/distributed computing. 

I've worked at Apple as a Software Engineering Intern for the past two summers, working on an internal batch compute platform with a Cloud Infra team in San Francisco (2025) and on writing lower-level, kernel software for Apple Silicon with the Core Operating Systems PCIE team in Austin (2024). The summer before these, I did research at the <a href="https://www.hilab.dev">HiLab</a>, a human-centered computing & IoT lab at UCLA, building an end-to-end system to analyze road conditions using electric scooters.
